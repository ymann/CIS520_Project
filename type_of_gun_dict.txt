PUBLICATION DATE: 7/28/2014Bridgeport man murdered in 9th homocide this year
Bridgeport, Connecticut -- Christopher Pettway, the city's ninth homicide victim this year, was recalled Wednesday as ""a man with morals and values'' by a family friend. Ernest Newton III, the former state senator, said he knew Pettway's family well, ""and he came from a good family. They are religious people.'' Pettway died in the hospital as a result of injuries from the shooting near Reservoir and Trumbull avenues at about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday, July 29th, police said. Pettway was only 26 years old when he passed. ""I grew up with his mother and father,'' Newton said. He had not spoken to Edward Pettway, Christopher's father, since the shooting, the family friend said. The Pettways are one of the city's largest families and Newton said he has talked to the dead man's cousins, ""who are taking this very hard, as you might imagine. It's another gunshot death. We have to make sure that we don't become another Hartford or New Haven.'' Kaempffer said the investigation was still ongoing. So far, it is known that 3 shots were fired using a 22 caliber pistol. Beyond that, Kaempffer said only that the police were ""following very strong leads,"" but did not release more de	424
